    <h2> How this works </h2>
    <p>
      We shuffle the player input and assign the "top of the deck" to one prize
      at a time.  All data resides in your web browser; the data is never
      uploaded to the server.  The implementation of the "Click here" button is
      entirely done on your computer.
    </p>

    <h2> Privacy Policy </h2>
    <p>
      This site does not use cookies or store data.  Your data never leaves
      your browser.
      <label>Click here <input type="radio" value="yes" name="gdpr"> to accept
        GDPR protections</label>
      <label>Click here <input type="radio" value="no" name="gdpr"> to reject
        GDPR protections</label>.
      It makes no difference because we don't keep your data.
      You're welcome?
    </p>
    
    <h2> Randomness </h2>
    <p>
      This version uses your browser's JavaScript's built-in Math.random() and
      the unfortunate realities of JavaScript IEEE-754 floating point.  That's
      OK for trivial things but I wouldn't recommend it for running your
      state's lottery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, we probably introduce a trivial bias by multiplying using
      the output of Math.random(); we have not verified the implementation of
      your browser's Math.random(); and the results are not publically
      verifyable or repeatable because we do not know the state of your
      browser's PRNG.  So maybe you want a witness or something, I dunno.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names are shuffled using a Fisher-Yates shuffle.  This is known to be
      generally fair if the RNG is fair, unless there are bugs.  A second
      random-sort shuffle implementation, helping to guard against bugs in the
      first shuffle.  This is known to have a small bias, but the
      implementation is less likely to have bugs.  Combined, they do a good
      [enough] job.
    </p>

    <h2> Ugliness </h2>
    <p>
      This is not a very attractive web site, or a very clever program.  But
      it's not bad for a couple hours on a Saturday when I had forgotten
      JavaScript again, eh?
